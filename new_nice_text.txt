At sixteen Rogoff dropped out of high school to concentrate on chess. At that time he met Bobby Fischer, who was impressed by Rogoff's "self-assured style and his knowing exactly what he wanted over the chessboard".[7] He won the United States Junior Championship in 1969 and spent the next several years living primarily in Europe and playing in tournaments there. However, at eighteen he made the decision to go to college and pursue a career in economics rather than to become a professional player, although he continued to play and improve for several years afterward. Rogoff was awarded the IM title in 1974, and the GM title in 1978. He was 3rd in the World Junior Championship of 1971 and finished 2nd in the US Championship of 1975, which doubled as a Zonal competition, a half point behind Walter Browne; this result qualified him for the 1976 Interzonal at Biel where he finished 13â€“15th. In other tournaments, he drew for first at Norristown in 1973 and at Orense in 1976.[8] He has also drawn individual games against former world champions Mikhail Tal[9] and Tigran V. Petrosian.[10] In 2012 he drew a blitz game with the world's highest rated player Magnus Carlsen.[11]
